# Script_Linux
 
 This is just a basic Linux script to install Minecraft and update your linux distro.
 There is more to come in the future. 
 I'll try and update the repo as soon as I have some time. 
 Let me know what you would like me to add into the script. 


 HOW TO USE:
 1. Clone the repo
 2. Execute the script with ./script_Linux.sh
